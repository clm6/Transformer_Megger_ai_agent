## ✅ FUNCTIONAL FEATURES TO RETAIN
6. **Turns Ratio Measurements (TTR):**
- Ensure **Nominal TTR, Measured TTR, Error %, Excitation Current, Phase Displacement** are included for all taps tested.
- Status logic:  
  • **OK** if `|Error %| ≤ 0.5%`  
  • **WARNING** if `0.5% < |Error %| ≤ 1%`  
  • **CRITICAL** if `|Error %| > 1%`
- Convert Excitation Current from µA to mA, round to 4 decimals.

7. **Winding Resistance Summary:**
- Display per phase and tap tested.
- Include both **resistance value**, **range**, and **unit** (mΩ or Ω).
- Status = OK if within range; CRITICAL if outside; WARNING if near limits.
- Confirm tap alignment across HV and LV.
 (WORKING ACCURATELY)
1. **Winding Resistance Measurement:**
   - Correct range detection for HV and LV.
   - Status ("OK") assigned correctly based on range and symmetry.
   - Proper Ω vs mΩ distinction confirmed.
   - Correct tap position mapping.

2. **Turns Ratio Analysis:**
   - Correct error % computed and thresholds applied (<±0.5% = OK).
   - Excitation current (converted from µA to mA) accurate.
   - Phase displacement rendered and displayed.
   - Nominal vs measured mapping and labeling validated.

3. **Tan Delta (Main Insulation):**
   - Values corrected to 20°C.
   - Status logic: OK < 0.3%, WARNING 0.3–0.5%, CRITICAL >0.5% → Applied correctly in most cases.
   - Monitoring and retest scheduling based on thresholds is aligned with diagnostics best practices.

4. **Demagnetization:**
   - Effective determination made when drop >20% and final <1%.
   - Reported correctly across all reports.

5. **General Reporting Logic:**
   - Asset and manufacturer metadata correctly extracted.
   - Overall Risk = CRITICAL when 2+ subsystems show CRITICAL.
   - Confidence Score and Risk Tags reflect findings.
   - Weather and tester info parsed accurately.

## 🛠️ AREAS TO IMPROVE
### E. MISSING SECTIONS (Detected in Recent Report):
- Turns Ratio and Winding Resistance often missing in final summaries.
- Ensure both are displayed in full, including:
  • Tap position  
  • Nominal and measured values  
  • Deviation % and unit  
  • Status flag  
- Without these, technical completeness is compromised.
 (RECURRING ISSUES OR EDGE CASES)

### A. TAN DELTA – STATUS MISCLASSIFICATION:
- In one report, CLG = 0.45% but was labeled “WARNING” instead of “CRITICAL”. Enforce:
  > `if PF > 0.5%: Status = CRITICAL`

- CLH = 0.55% was correctly labeled as CRITICAL in another report. Keep this as reference.

### B. BUSHING PF CORRECTIONS:
- **Threshold Inconsistency:** Use consistent thresholds:
  > `CRITICAL if PF > 0.5%`, `WARNING if 0.3% < PF ≤ 0.5%`, else `OK`.

- In one case, H1/H2/H3 were labeled OK with PF = 0.52%. Should have been CRITICAL.
- Some reports had missing values (e.g. “⚠️ Unknown”) — infer based on similar phase if missing value is bounded.

### C. REMANENCE LOGIC – EFFECTIVENESS
- Flag demagnetization as INEFFECTIVE if:
  > `Initial Remanence < 20%` regardless of % reduction.

- One case had initial = 2.013%, final = 0.9%, which was incorrectly labeled "Effective". Update logic to match above.

### D. COMBINED DIAGNOSTIC LOGIC
- If **2+ bushings** or **any insulation path** (CLG/CLH/CHG) is critical:
  - Auto-flag `Immediate Action Required = TRUE`.
  - Set `Overall Health = CRITICAL`.

## 💡 SUGGESTED ENHANCEMENTS

1. **Confidence Scoring:**
   - Add numeric score per subsystem: e.g., “CLG PF = 0.64% (Confidence: High)”

2. **Visual Indicators:**
   - Recommend output format with 🚨/⚠️/✅ symbols in summary if generating for UI display.

3. **Critical Pattern Detection:**
   - If all X bushings >0.9% PF → flag “LV Bushing Cluster Degradation”.
   - If CLG + X bushings = CRITICAL → suggest “Moisture & interface fault likely.”

---


7. **Comprehensive Completeness Check Logic:**
   - For each report, verify inclusion of:
     • Winding Resistance (all 3 phases, both HV and LV, with tap)
     • Turns Ratio (Nominal vs Measured, all taps)
     • Excitation Current in mA, rounded to 4 decimals
     • PF summaries for CHL, CLG, CLH, CHG
     • All bushings (H1-H3, X0-X3)
     • Demagnetization effectiveness
   - If all components are found, append summary: “✅ Technical Completeness Verified”

8. **Improved Excitation Current Validation:**
   - Confirm Excitation Current unit is properly converted to mA.
   - Round to 4 decimals and assert against expected operating ranges (e.g. 0.5–7.0 mA range).

9. **Tap Coverage Summary:**
   - Explicitly state tap coverage range in TTR analysis.
   - Raise WARNING if not all taps tested.

10. **Cluster Analysis Auto-Flagging:**
    - If all H bushings are CRITICAL (e.g., PF > 0.5%), flag “HV Cluster Degradation: Immediate Replacement Recommended”

11. **Zero-Tolerance Status Reinforcement:**
    - If 2+ CRITICAL flags across any subsystem → auto-assign `Overall Status: CRITICAL`
    - Ensure Immediate Action Flag is `TRUE` and rationale is included in summary.


## ✅ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT AFTER:
- Reinforcement of PF threshold logic for both insulation and bushings.
- Correction to remanence-based demag status logic.
- Confirmation of all-unit consistency across Ω, mΩ, %, µA vs mA.

🔍 **NEWLY DERIVED FEATURES FROM TRANSFORMER_20250728_180421 ANALYSIS**

1. **Improved Bushing Cluster Interpretation**:
   - Grouped HV vs LV bushings degradation patterns (e.g., H2 + X1 both CRITICAL → possible broader dielectric stress).
   - Added recommendation logic for POOR status if 2+ bushings exceed 0.5%.

2. **Refined Moisture Flag Logic**:
   - Flag moisture if **any two of CLG, CLH, or CHG exceed 0.4%** and one exceeds **0.5%**.
   - Add explicit recommendation if CLG > 0.5% and CHG > 0.25%.

3. **Expanded Demagnetization Verification**:
   - Assert "Effective" only if Initial Remanence >20% AND Final Remanence <1%.
   - If Initial <20%, override status as "Ineffective".

4. **Explicit Tap Position Tracking**:
   - Capture tap position for TTR and resistance results separately.
   - Recommend consistency checks if HV and LV positions mismatch.

5. **Confidence Tag Inheritance**:
   - If a parent category has mixed statuses but all HIGH confidence, escalate priority in follow-up recommendations.

6. **Pattern Matching for Hidden Risk**:
   - WARNING status in CLH + CRITICAL bushing on same phase (e.g., H2) → elevate to HIGH ATTENTION recommendation.
